## Overview

This plugin weaves AspectJ aspects into your classes using the AspectJ compiler `ajc`.
Typically, aspects are used in one of two ways within your Maven reactors:

* As part of a Single Project, implying aspects and code are defined within the same Maven project.
  This is the simplest approach to start out with; feel free to examine the
  "Examples: Single-project AspectJ use" to better understand single-project use.

* As part of a Multi-module Maven Reactor where one/some project(s) contains aspects and other
  projects within the Maven reactor contain code using the aspects ("woven by the aspects").
  This is a more complex and powerful approach, best suited when several Maven projects should be woven
  by a common set of aspects. The "Examples: Multi-module AspectJ use" contains a basic walk-through
  of this approach.
